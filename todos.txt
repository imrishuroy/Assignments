In my opinion , It's throwing this error because of the time which you selected is before than now . In their pub.dev page , there is an example for solve this problem .

tz.TZDateTime _nextInstanceOfTenAM() {
final tz.TZDateTime now = tz.TZDateTime.now(tz.local);
tz.TZDateTime scheduledDate =
    tz.TZDateTime(tz.local, now.year, now.month, now.day, 10);
if (scheduledDate.isBefore(now)) {
  scheduledDate = scheduledDate.add(const Duration(days: 1));
}
return scheduledDate;
}

 [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state.cc(199)] Unhandled Exception: dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<_ModalScopeStatus>() or dependOnInheritedElement() was called before _AddEditScreenState.initState() completed.
E/flutter (26700): When an inherited widget changes, for example if the value of Theme.of() changes, its dependent widgets are rebuilt. If the dependent widget's reference to the inherited widget is in a constructor or an initState() method, then the rebuilt dependent widget will not reflect the changes in the inherited widget.
E/flutter (26700): Typically references to inherited widgets should occur in widget build() methods. Alternatively, initialization based on inherited widgets can be placed in the didChangeDependencies method, which is called after initState and whenever the dependencies change thereafter.

[!] CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set. In order for CocoaPods integration to work at all, please either set the base configurations of the target `Runner` to `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig` or include the `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig` in your build configuration (`Flutter/Release.xcconfig`).
